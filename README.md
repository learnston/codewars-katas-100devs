# Codewars Katas in JavaScript

This repository contains a collection of Codewars katas implemented in JavaScript. The katas are organized by level (7kyu and below) and subject, such as arrays, data structures, etc. Each JavaScript file in this repository corresponds to a specific kata and includes a link to the kata itself.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone git@github.com:learnston/codewars-katas-100devs.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```shell
   cd codewars-katas-100devs
   ```

3. Browse through the folders based on the subject and desired level.
4. Open the JavaScript file for a specific kata and locate the link to the kata at the top of the file.
5. Read the kata description and attempt to solve it on your own. Remember, it's important to challenge yourself and try to find the solution without immediately looking for answers.
6. If you're unable to solve the kata after 20 minutes or feel stuck, feel free to refer to the solutions provided in the file or search for alternative solutions online.
